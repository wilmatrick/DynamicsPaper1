\subsection{What if our assumed distribution function differs from the stars' DF?}

\cite{san15} and ??? develop extended distribution functions (EDFs), that extend action-based DFs to also describe the distribution of the star's metallicities. While a full chemo-dynamical modelling,  including metallicity as well as $\alpha$- and other chemical abundances, is ultimately the right way to go, the form of the EDFs still depends on a lot of additional assumptions. By looking at fig. 6 in \cite{bov13} (other references???) we doubt that a final version of an EDF will have a simple form in action-metallicity space. Motivated by the findings by Bovy et al. 2012, we therefore resign to the simpler approach outlined in \cite{bov13} and here, were metallicity and $\alpha$-abundances are implicitly taken into account by describing each MAP separately by one qDF. This procedure could have two caveats: 
\\First, the binning of the stars according to their abundances could lead to pollution of one MAP, by either choosing the bin sizes too large, or too small compared to the stars' inherent abundance errors. 
\\Second, while \citet{tin13} makes us confident that the qDF is indeed a good functional form to describe each MAP, it could very well be, that the stars' true distribution is close to but not exactly of the family of assumed qDFs. 
\\We try to investigate both this issues with the following test: We draw two mock data sets, each from a different qDF, and mix the stars in different fractions together. We then analyse this mixture by assuming all stars sill came from a single qDF. The results are shown in fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont} and \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixDiff}. 
\\In example 1 and 2 (fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont}) we consider two very different MAPs, a hotter and a cooler one, that are mixed together in different fractions. This test could be understood as the true distribution of stars being a linear combination of two very different qDFs and we investigate how this deviation from a single qDF affects the potential recovery. We find that for a MAP that follows approximately a hot population (polluted by up to $\sim30\%$ of cooler stars), the potential can still be very well recovered. The analysis of cooler MAPs are much more affected by pollution due to hotter MAP stars.
\\In example 3 and 4 (fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixDiff}) it is investigated how different the qDF parameters of two MAPs are allowed to be to be still able to constrain the true potential. This test could be seen as a model scenario for decreasing bin sizes in the metallicity-$\alpha$ plane when sorting stars in different MAPs, assuming that there is a smooth variation of qDF within the metallicity-$\alpha$ plane. We find that differences of $20\%$ in the qDF parameters of two neighbouring MAPs can still give quite good constraints on the potential parameters. We compare this with the relative difference in the qDF parameters in the bins in fig. 6 of \cite{bov13}, which have sizes of $[Fe/H] = 0.1$ dex and $\Delta [\alpha/Fe] = 0.05$ dex. It seems that these bin sizes are large enough to make sure that $\sigma_{R,0}$ and $\sigma_{z,0}$ of neighbouring MAPs do not differ more than $20\%$. As fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont} and \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixDiff} suggests especially the tracer scale length $h_R$ needs to be recovered to get the potential right. For this parameter however the bin sizes in fig. 6 of \cite{bov13} might not yet be small enough to ensure no more than $20\%$ of difference in neighbouring $h_R$, especially in the low-$\alpha$ ($[\alpha/Fe] \lesssim 0.2$), intermediate-metallicity ($[Fe/H] \sim -0.5$) MAPs.

[TO DO: think, if this might better be two different sections. ???? one for MixDiff about neighbouring MAPS and one for MixCont for difference in DF. ????]

\caption{Distribution of mock data in two coordinates ($R$ and $v_z$), created by mixing stars drawn from two different qDFs. This demonstrates how mixing two qDFs can be used as a test case for changing the shape of the DF to not follow a pure qDF anymore, e.g. by adding wings or slightly changing the radial density profile. The distribution in $R$ is also strongly shaped by the selection function, which is, in this case, a sphere around the sun with $r_\text{max}=2$ kpc. In total there are always 20,000 stars in each data set and all of them were created in the same potential, the isochrone potential "Iso-Pot" from table \ref{tbl:referencepotentials}. The dark red and dark blue histograms show data sets drawn from a single qDF only: the "hot" and "cooler" \MAPs (Example 1, first column), the "cool" and "hotter" \MAPs (Example 2, second column), the "hot" (Example 3, third column) and the "cool" \MAPs (Example 4, fourth column) from table \ref{tbl:referenceMAPs}. \emph{Example 1 \& 2:} The other histograms show data drawn from a superposition of the two reference qDFs. The color coding represents the different mixing rates (reddish: more hot stars, bluish: more cool stars, white: half/half) and is the same as in figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont}, where the corresponding modelling results for each data set are depicted in the same color. \emph{Example 3 \& 4:} In this test suite the mixing rate of the two \MAPs is fixed to 50\%/50\%. In Example 3 (Example 4) in the third (fourth) column the "hot" ("cool") \MAP is shown in dark red (dark blue) and mixed with a qDF whose parameters describe a colder (warmer) population. The 'hotness' of these second \MAP is varied and approaches the "hot" ("cool") \MAP's qDF parameters as the histograms get redder (bluer). The color coding is the same as in fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixDiff}.}

  \caption{(Continued.) The dependence of the parameter recovery on degree of pollution and 'hotness' of the stellar population. To model the pollution of a hot stellar population by stars coming from a cool population and vice versa, we mix varying amounts of stars from two very different populations, as indicated on the $x$-axis. The composite mock data set is then fit with one single qDF. The violines represent the marginalized likelihoods found from the MCMC analysis. The mock data sets are shown in fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont_mockdata}, in the same colors as the violins here. All mock data sets come from the same potential ("Iso-Pot") and selection function (sphere with $r_\text{max} = 2$ kpc). The true potential parameters are indicated by green dotted lines. Example 1 (Example 2) in the left (right) panels mixes the "hot" ("cool") \MAP with the "cooler" ("hotter") \MAP in table \ref{tbl:referenceMAPs}. True parameters of the hotter (colder) of the two populations are shown as red (blue) dotted lines. We find, that a hot population is much less affected by pollution with stars from a cooler population than vice versa.  [TO DO: This was done using the current qDF to set the fitting range. Nvelocity=24 and Nsigma=5 is high enough (though not perfect). Maybe redo with fiducial qDF to be consistent with MixDiff test. ???]}

  \caption{(Continued.) The dependence of the parameter recovery on the difference in qDF parameters of the 50\%/50\% mixture of two stellar populations and their 'hotness'. Each mock data set in Example 3 (Example 4) consists of 20,000 stars, half of them drawn from the "hot" ("cool") qDF in table \ref{tbl:referenceMAPs}, and the other half drawn from a colder (warmer) population that has $X\%$ smaller (larger) $\sigma_R$ and $\sigma_z$ and $X\%$ larger (smaller) $h_R$. The difference $X$ in these qDF parameters is indicated on the $x$-axis, and the true parameters of the two qDFs are indicated by the dotted red and blue lines. Each composite mock data set is fitted by a single qDF and the marginalized MCMC likelihoods for the best fit parameters are shown as violines in the third (fourth) column of panels. The mock data was created within the same potential ("Iso-Pot") and selection function (sphere with $r_\text{max} = 2$ kpc). The true potential parameters are indicated by green dotted lines. The data sets are shown in figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont_mockdata}, where the histograms have the same colors as the corresponding best fit violines here. By mixing \MAPs with varying difference in their qDF parameters, we model the effect of bin size in the [Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] plane when sorting stars into different \MAPs: The smaller the bin size, the smaller the difference in qDF parameters of stars in the same bin. We find that the bin sizes should be chosen such that the difference in qDF parameters between neighbouring \MAPs is less than 20\%.
[TO DO: Maybe different/same x-axis???] [TO DO: This was done using the current qDF to set the fitting range. Nvelocity=24 and Nsigma=5 is not high enough for the largest differences, i.e. grid search and MCMC converge to different values. Redo with fiducial qDF.] [TO DO: Add in plot a label, that it is a 50\%/50\% mix of a hot and a cold population.??])}
