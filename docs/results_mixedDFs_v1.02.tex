\subsection{What if our assumed distribution function differs from the stars' DF?}

\cite{san15} and ??? develop extended distribution functions (EDFs), that extend action-based DFs to also describe the distribution of the star's metallicities. While a full chemo-dynamical modelling,  including metallicity as well as $\alpha$- and other chemical abundances, is ultimately the right way to go, the form of the EDFs still depends on a lot of additional assumptions. By looking at fig. 6 in \cite{bov13} (other references???) we doubt that a final version of an EDF will have a simple form in action-metallicity space. Motivated by the findings by Bovy et al. 2012, we therefore resign to the simpler approach outlined in \cite{bov13} and here, were metallicity and $\alpha$-abundances are implicitly taken into account by describing each MAP separately by one qDF. This procedure could have two caveats: 
\\First, the binning of the stars according to their abundances could lead to pollution of one MAP, by either choosing the bin sizes too large, or too small compared to the stars' inherent abundance errors. 
\\Second, while \citet{tin13} makes us confident that the qDF is indeed a good functional form to describe each MAP, it could very well be, that the stars' true distribution is close to but not exactly of the family of assumed qDFs. 
\\We try to investigate both this issues with the following test: We draw two mock data sets, each from a different qDF, and mix the stars in different fractions together. We then analyse this mixture by assuming all stars sill came from a single qDF. The results are shown in fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont} and \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixDiff}. 
\\In example 1 and 2 (fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont}) we consider two very different MAPs, a hotter and a cooler one, that are mixed together in different fractions. This test could be understood as the true distribution of stars being a linear combination of two very different qDFs and we investigate how this deviation from a single qDF affects the potential recovery. We find that for a MAP that follows approximately a hot population (polluted by up to $\sim30\%$ of cooler stars), the potential can still be very well recovered. The analysis of cooler MAPs are much more affected by pollution due to hotter MAP stars.
\\In example 3 and 4 (fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixDiff}) it is investigated how different the qDF parameters of two MAPs are allowed to be to be still able to constrain the true potential. This test could be seen as a model scenario for decreasing bin sizes in the metallicity-$\alpha$ plane when sorting stars in different MAPs, assuming that there is a smooth variation of qDF within the metallicity-$\alpha$ plane. We find that differences of $20\%$ in the qDF parameters of two neighbouring MAPs can still give quite good constraints on the potential parameters. We compare this with the relative difference in the qDF parameters in the bins in fig. 6 of \cite{bov13}, which have sizes of $[Fe/H] = 0.1$ dex and $\Delta [\alpha/Fe] = 0.05$ dex. It seems that these bin sizes are large enough to make sure that $\sigma_{R,0}$ and $\sigma_{z,0}$ of neighbouring MAPs do not differ more than $20\%$. As fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont} and \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixDiff} suggests especially the tracer scale length $h_R$ needs to be recovered to get the potential right. For this parameter however the bin sizes in fig. 6 of \cite{bov13} might not yet be small enough to ensure no more than $20\%$ of difference in neighbouring $h_R$, especially in the low-$\alpha$ ($[\alpha/Fe] \lesssim 0.2$), intermediate-metallicity ($[Fe/H] \sim -0.5$) MAPs.

[TO DO: think, if this might better be two different sections. ???? one for MixDiff about neighbouring MAPS and one for MixCont for difference in DF. ????]

\caption{[TO DO: Re-write caption] Distribution of mock data in two coordinates ($R$ and $v_z$), created by mixing different amounts of stars drawn from two different qDFs. The red and blue histograms show data sets drawn from a single qDF only: the "hot" and the "cooler" \MAPs (Example 1) in the left panels, and the "cool" and "hotter" \MAPs (Example 2) in the right panels (see table \ref{tbl:referenceMAPs}). The gray histograms show data drawn from a superpositions of two qDFs. In total there are always 20,000 stars in the data set. The color coding represents the different mixing rates (black - all hot, bright gray - all cool) and is the same as in figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont}, where the corresponding modelling results for each data set are shown. This demonstrates how mixing two qDFs can be used as a test case for adding or removing wings to a pure qDF or slightly changing the radial density profile. The distribution in $R$ is also strongly shaped by the selection function, which is, in this case, a sphere around the sun with $r_\text{max}=2$ kpc.}

  \caption{(Continued.)  [TO DO: Re-write caption] The dependence of the parameter recovery on degree of pollution and 'hotness' of the stellar population. To model the pollution of a hot stellar population by stars coming from a cool population and vice versa, we mix varying amounts of stars from two very different populations, as indicated on the $x$-axis. (The corresponding mock data sets are shown, in the same gray scales, in fig. \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMixCont_mockdata}.)  Both populations come from same potential, the isochrone potential "Iso-Pot" from table \ref{tbl:referencepotentials}  (true potential parameters are indicated by green lines). The composite data set is then fit with one single qDF. Example 1 (left) mixes the "hot" \MAP with the "cooler" \MAP in table \ref{tbl:referenceMAPs}, while example 2 (right) mixes the "cool" \MAP with the "hotter" \MAP. True parameters of the hotter of the two populations are shown as red lines, those of the cooler populations as blue lines. The violines represent the marginalized likelihoods found from the MCMC analysis. [TO DO: This was done using the current qDF to set the fitting range. Nvelocity=24 and Nsigma=5 is high enough (though not perfect). Maybe redo with fiducial qDF to be consistent with MixDiff test. ???]}
