\subsection{Effect of measurement errors on recovery of potential?}

\paragraph{Collection of possible tests and plots}

\begin{itemize}
\item *Plot 1:* The plot I had on the poster, which shows the number of MC samples needed for given maximum error. However, we still haven't tested, if this plot depends on: 
    * hotness of stars
    * number of stars
\item *Plot 2:* Some plot that shows, that our approximation of ignoring distance errors works. Any ideas?
\item *Test 1:* One selection function, one population, vary the size of the proper motion error (don't forget to adapt the number of MC samples needed) \\
*Plot 3:* (width of pdf) vs. (maximum velocity error / temperature parameter)
\end{itemize}
