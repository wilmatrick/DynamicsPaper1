\subsection{The Role of the Survey Volume Geometry} \label{sec:results_obsvolume}

Beyond the sample size, the survey volume {\it per se} must play a role; clearly, even a vast and perfect data set of stars within 100~pc of the Sun, has limited power to tell us about the potential at very different $R$. Intuitively, having dynamical tracers over a wide range in $R$ suggests to allow tighter constraints on the radial dependence of the potential. To this end, we devise two suites of mock data sets: 
\\The first one draws mock data from the same \pmodel (see Test \textcircled{4} in Table \ref{tbl:tests}), but from four different volume wedges (see \S\ref{sec:selectionfunction}), illustrated in the right upper panel of fig. \ref{fig:wedFlexVol_bias_vs_SE}. To make the parameter inference comparison very differential, the mock data sets are equally large (20,000) in all cases, and are drawn from identical total survey volumes ($4.5~\text{kpc}^3$, achieved by adjusting the angular width of the edges). We perform the same test for three different potential models ("Iso-Pot", "MW14-Pot" and "KKS-Pot").
\\The results of this first mock suite are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:wedFlexVol_bias_vs_SE} for all potential fit parameters. The mock suite was created to investigate the influence of \emph{position and shape} of the survey volume within the Galaxy, together with the \emph{choice of potential model}. 
\\The second suite of mock data sets was already introduced in \S\ref{sec:largedata} (see also Test \textcircled{3}), where mock data sets were drawn from five spherical volumes around the sun with different maximum radius, for two "Iso-Pot"s and two different \MAPs.
\\The results of this second suite are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:centrallimittheorem} for one potential and one qDF parameter ($\ln(h_{\sigma,z})$) and demonstrate the effect of the \emph{size and extent} of the survey volume together with the \emph{choice of the \MAP and model parameters}.

The left panels in Fig. \ref{fig:centrallimittheorem} and \ref{fig:wedFlexVol_bias_vs_SE} illustrate the ability of \RM to constrain model parameters, with the standard error of the \pdf as measure of the precision on the $x$-axis. Fig. \ref{fig:centrallimittheorem} demonstrates that, given a choice of qDF and potential parameters, a larger volume always results in tighter constraints. There is no obvious trend that a hotter or cooler \MAP will always give better results; it depends on the survey volume and the model parameter in question. In Fig. \ref{fig:wedFlexVol_bias_vs_SE} the wedges all have the same size and all give results of similar precision. Minor differences, e.g. with the "Iso-Pot" potential being less constraint in the wedge with large vertical, but small radial extent, are a special property of the considered potential and parameters, and not a global property of the corresponding survey volume. In the case of an axisymmetric model galaxy, the extent in $\phi$ direction is not expected to matter. Overall radial extent and vertical extent seem therefore to be equally important to constrain the potential. In addition Fig. \ref{fig:wedFlexVol_bias_vs_SE} implies that for these cases volumes offsets in the radial or vertical direction have at most modest impact - at least at given sample size.
\\While we believe the argument for significant radial and vertical extent is generic, we have not done a full exploration of all combinations of \pmodel~ and volumina.

\caption{Bias vs. standard error in recovering the potential parameters for mock data stars drawn four different test observation volumes within the Galaxy (illustrated in the upper right panel) and three different potentials ("Iso-Pot", "MW13-Pot" and "KKS-Pot" from Table \ref{tbl:referencepotentials}, top to bottom row). Standard error and offset were determined as in fig. \ref{fig:centrallimittheorem}. Per volume and potential we analyse four different mock data realisations; all model parameters are shown as Test \textcircled{4} in Table \ref{tbl:tests}. The colour-coding represents the different wedge-shaped observation volumes. The angular extent of each wedge-shaped observation volume was adapted such that all have the volume of $4.5 \text{ kpc}^3$, even though their extent in $(R,z)$ is different.  Overall there is no clear trend, that an observation volume around the sun, above the disk or at smaller Galactocentric radii should give remarkably better constraints on the potential the other volumes. [TO DO: MW-Pot and KKS-Pot analyses suffer from too low accuracy in action calculation (with StaeckelGrid). Used the StaeckelGrid for BOTH mock data and analysis, but the mock data distribution would actually not look exactly like the desired qDF distribution, i.e. this plot basically is created with a messed up DF. Don't know how higher accuracy would change the plot. The orange Iso-Pot analysis suffers from too small integration range in vT. More coding required, before redoing this.]}
