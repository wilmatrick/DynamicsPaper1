\subsection{Mock Data} \label{sec:mockdata}

One goal of this work is to test how the loss of information in the process of measuring stellar phase-space coordinates can affect the outcome of the modelling. To investigate this, we assume first that our measured stars do indeed come from our assumed families of potentials and distribution functions and draw mock data from a given true distribution. In further steps we can manipulate and modify these mock data sets to mimick observational effects.\\
The distribution function is given in terms of actions and angles. The transformation $(\vect{J}_i,\vect{\theta}_i) \longrightarrow (\vect{x}_i,\vect{v}_i)$ is however difficult to perform and computationally much more expensive than the transformation $(\vect{x}_i,\vect{v}_i) \longrightarrow (\vect{J}_i,\vect{\theta}_i)$. We propose a fast and simple two-step method for drawing mock data from an action distribution function, which also accounts effectively for a given survey selection function.


\paragraph{Preparation: Tracer density.} We first setup the interpolation grid for the tracer density $\rho(R,|z| \mid p_\Phi, p_\text{DF})$ generated by the given qDF and according to \S\ref{sec:qDF} and Eq. \ref{eq:tracerdensity}. For the creation of the mock data we use $N_\text{spatial} = 20$, $N_\text{velocity} = 40$ and $N_\text{sigma}=5$.

\paragraph{Step 1: Drawing positions from the selection function.} To get positions $\vect{x}_i$ for our mock data stars, we first sample random positions $(R_i,z_i,\phi_i)$ uniformly from the observed volume. Then we apply a rejection Monte Carlo method to these positions using the pre-calculated $\rho_\text{DF}(R,|z| \mid p_{\Phi},p_\text{DF})$. In an optional third step, if we want to apply a non-uniform selection function, sf$(\vect{x}) \neq $ const. within the observed volume, we use the rejection method a second time. The sample then follows 
\begin{equation*}
\vect{x}_i \longrightarrow p(\vect{x}) \propto \rho_\text{DF}(R,z \mid p_{\Phi},p_\text{DF}) \times \text{sf}(\vect{x}).
\end{equation*}

\paragraph{Step 2: Drawing velocities according to the distribution function.} The velocities are independent of the selection function and observed volume. For each of the positions $(R_i,z_i)$ we now sample velocities directly from the qDF$(R_i,z_i,\vect{v} \mid p_{Phi},p_\text{DF})$ using a rejection method. To reduce the number of rejected velocities, we use a Gaussian in velocity space as an envelope function, from which we first randomly sample velocities and then apply the rejection method to shape the Gaussian velocity distribution towards the velocity distribution predicted by the qDF. We now have a mock data set according to the required:
\begin{equation*}
(\vect{x}_i,\vect{v}_i) \longrightarrow p(\vect{x},\vect{v}) \propto \text{qDF}(\vect{x},\vect{v} \mid p_{\Phi},p_\text{DF}) \times \text{sf}(\vect{x}).
\end{equation*}

\caption{[TO DO: Rewrite caption] Distribution of mock data in action space (2D iso-density contours in the two central and the lower left panel) and configuration space (1D histograms in right panels), depending shape and position of observation volume (cf. lower left panel) and 'hottness' of the stellar population. The mock data was created in a 2-component KK-Staeckel-potential (cf. ???) with parameters $p_\Phi = \{v_\text{circ}, \Delta, (a/c)_\text{disk},(a/c)_{halo},k)\} = \{230\text{ km s$^{-1}$},0.3,20.,1.07, 0.28\}$ [TO DO: Does $\Delta$ have units????] (which is an approximate fit to the MilkyWay2014 potential in Galpy). We use two stellar populations, a 'hot' one with $p_{DF,hot} = \{ h_R, \sigma_R, \sigma_z,h_{\sigma_R},h_{\sigma_z}\} =\{2 \text{ kpc}, 55 \text{ km s$^{-1}$}, 66 \text{ km s$^{-1}$}, 8 \text{ kpc}, 7 \text{ kpc }\} $ (red lines) and a 'cool' population with $p_{DF,cool} = \{ h_R, \sigma_R, \sigma_z,h_{\sigma_R},h_{\sigma_z}\} =\{3.5 \text{ kpc}, 42 \text{ km s$^{-1}$}, 32 \text{ km s$^{-1}$}, 8 \text{ kpc}, 7 \text{ kpc }\} $ (blue lines). In the upper left panel we demonstrate the shape of the two different observation volumes within which we were creating each a 'hot' and a 'cool' mock data set: a large volume centered on the Galactic plane (solid lines in all plots) and a smaller one above the plane (dashed lines in all plots). Both volumes have an angular extent of $\Delta\phi \pm 20^\circ$. Each of the four mock data sets compared in this plot has 20,000 stars in it. The stars of the 'cool' population have in general lower radial and vertical actions, i.e. are on more circular obrits. The different ranges of $L_z$'s in the two volumes reflect $L_z \sim R  v_\text{circ}$ and the different radial extent of both volumes.The volume above the plane contains no stars with $J_z = 0$ and more with $J_z$: The higher a volume is located above the plane, the larger $J_z$ has to be for the star's orbit to cross this volume. Circular orbits with $J_R = 0$ and $J_z = 0$ can obviously only be observed in the Galactic mid-plane. The smaller an orbit's $L_z$, the smaller also its mean orbital radius. For this orbit to be able to reach into a volume located at larger Galacto-centric radius, it needs to be more eccentric and therefore have a larger $J_z$. This anti-correlation between $L_z$ and $J_R$ can be seen in the top central panel. Orbits with both large $J_R$ and large $J_z$ would be very energetic and are therefore less likely to be observed.

%\paragraph{[TO DO] Stuff to explain about fig. \ref{fig:mockdatadistr}:} Shift description of action space from caption to here. Mention, that the distribution according to the qdf in configuration space is indeed how expected: More stars at lower R and lower $|z|$, uniform in $\phi$. Using the velocity dispersion (with $\sigma_0$ being indeed the velocity dispersion at the sun) as integration ranges over $v_R$ and $v_z$ is fine. Maybe overplot $\pm5\sigma_0$ range? For $v_T$ distribution: Explain asymmetric drift. Would $v_T$ for a potential with perfectly flat rotation curve peak at 230km/s? This potential has only an approximately flat rotation curve.\\Cool and hot have different anisotropy --> difference between cool and hot in $J_R$ and $J_z$ is therefore different. \\Asymmetric drift at a given radius: 1) density profile: more stars inside as compared to outside. stars from inside come from smaller radius and are currently at their apocenter --> slower as circular velocity. --> more likely to be observed as stars from outside at their pericenter. 2) dispersion profile: stars on larger radii are on more circular orbits, because lower velocity dispersion. --> there are even less pericenter stars from the outside in the sample. more stars on non-circular orbits in the inside --> more likely to reach out.

\paragraph{Introducing measurement errors.} If we want to add measurement errors to the mock data, we need to apply two modifications to the above procedure.
\\First, measurement errors are best described in the phase-space of observables. We use the heliocentric coordinate system right ascension and declination $(\alpha,\delta)$ and distance modulus $(m-M)$ as proxy for the distance from the sun, the proper motion in both $\alpha$ and $\delta$ direction $(\mu_\alpha,\mu_\delta)$ and the line-of-sight velocity $v_\text{los}$. For the conversion between these observables and the Galactocentric cylindrical coordinate system in which the analysis takes place, we need the position and velocity of the sun, which we set for simplicity in this study to be $(R_\odot,z_\odot)=(8,0)$ kpc and $(v_R,v_T,v_z)=(0,230,0)$ km s$^{-1}$. We assume Gaussian measurement errors in the observables $\tilde{\vect{x}} = (\alpha,\delta,(m-M)), \tilde{\vect{v}} = (\mu_\alpha,\mu_\delta,v_\text{los})$.
\\Second, in the case of distance errors, stars can virtually scatter in and out of the observed volume. To account for this, we first draw "true" positions from a volume that is larger than the actual observation volume, perturb the stars positions according to the distance errors and then reject all stars that lie now outside of the observed volume. This procedure mirrors the Poisson scatter around the detection threshold for stars whose distances are determined from the apparent brightness and the distance modulus. [TO DO: Can I say it like this???] We then sample velocities (given the "true" positions of the stars) as described above and perturb them according to the measurement errors as well.
