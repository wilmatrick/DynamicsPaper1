\section{Discussion and Summary}

[TO DO]

\paragraph{Some notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Summarize all results, discuss how encouraging they are.
\item Normalisation needs to be very accurate --> our approach is very computationally expensive. Extremely large number of stars will require extremely high accuracy --> Need to figure out how to deal with the extreme computational costs then.
\item Discuss doubts in Binney papers w.r.t. to our results, especially on binning the MAPs.
\item Discuss non-axisymmetry
\item Mention that in non-axisymmetric potentials actions are not conserved anymore, but at least vertical action seems to be conserved during radial migration. Actions also invariant during adiabatic potential changes.
\end{itemize}
