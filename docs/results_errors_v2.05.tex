\subsection{Measurement uncertainties and their effect on the parameter recovery} \label{sec:results_errors}

Measurement uncertainties in proper motions and distance dominate over uncertainties in position on the sky (RA and Dec) and line-of-sight velocity, which can be more accurately determined.

We first investigate the impact of (perfectly known) proper motion uncertainties on the precision of the potential parameter recovery (see Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexErrConv_SE_vs_error} in Table \ref{tbl:tests}). Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexErrConv_SE_vs_error} demonstrates that for data sets with $\delta \mu$ as high as $5~\text{mas yr}^{-1}$ the precision degrades by  a factor of no more than $\sim2$ as compared to a data set without measurement uncertainties. The precision gets monotonically better for smaller $\delta \mu$, being larger only by a factor of $\sim 1.15$ at $\delta \mu=1~\text{mas yr}^{-1}$. With relative standard errors on the recovered parameters of only a few percent at most for 10,000 stars, this means we still get quite precise constraints on the potential, as long as we know the proper motion uncertainties perfectly.

The relative standard error (SE) derived from the marginalized \pdf{} for each model parameter was determined for precise data sets without measurement uncertainties (solid lines, with dotted lines indicating the error) and for data sets affected by different proper motion uncertainties $\delta \mu$ and $\delta v_\text{los}=2~\text{km s}^{-1}$ (data points with errors), but no uncertainties in position. The errors come from taking the mean over the results from several data sets.}

\caption{Potential parameter recovery using the approximation for the model probability convolved with measurement uncertainties in Equation \ref{eq:errorconv}. We show  \pdf{} offset and relative width (i.e., standard error SE) for the potential parameters derived from mock data sets (created according to Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexErrConv_bias_vs_SE} in Table \ref{tbl:tests}). The data sets in the left panels have only uncertainties in line-of-sight velocity and proper motions, while the data sets in the right panels also have distance (modulus) uncertainties, as indicated in the legends in the first row. For data sets with proper motion uncertainties $\delta \mu \leq 3 ~\text{mas yr}^{-1}$ Equation \ref{eq:errorconv} was evaluated with $N_\text{samples}=800$, for $\delta \mu > 3~\text{mas yr}^{-1}$ we used $N_\text{samples}=1200$. In absence of distance uncertainties Equation \ref{eq:errorconv} gives unbiased results. For $\delta(m-M) \geq 3~\text{mas yr}^{-1}$ (which corresponds in this test to $\delta v_\text{max} \lesssim 43~\text{km s}^{-1}$, see Equation \ref{eq:vmax}) however biases of several sigma are introduced as Equation \ref{eq:errorconv} is only an approximation for the true likelihood in this case. \Wilma{[TO DO: $\text{km s}^{-1}$ and $\text{mas yr}^{-1}$]}}

(The true model parameters used to create the mock data are summarized as Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexErrSyst} in Table \ref{tbl:tests}, four of them are indicated as black dotted lines in this figure.) The velocities of the mock data were perturbed according to Gaussian uncertainties in the RA and Dec proper motions as indicated on the $x$-axis. The circles and triangles are the best fit parameters of several mock data sets assuming the proper motion uncertainty, with which the model probability was convolved, was underestimated in the analysis by 10\% or 50\%, respectively. The error bars correspond to 1 sigma confidence. The solid lines connect the mean of each two data realisations and are just to guide the eye. \Wilma{[TO DO: $\text{km s}^{-1}$ and $\text{mas yr}^{-1}$]}}

We also note that in this case the relative and absolute difference in recovered precision between the precise and the measurement uncertainty-affected data set does not seem to depend strongly on the kinematic temperature of the stellar population.

Secondly, we investigate the impact of additional measurement uncertainties in distance (modulus). In absence of distance uncertainties the uncertainty-convolved likelihood given in Equation \ref{eq:errorconv} is unbiased.  When including distance (modulus) uncertainties, Equation \ref{eq:errorconv} is just an approximation for the true likelihood. The systematic bias thus introduced in the parameter recovery gets larger with the size of the error, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexErrConv_bias_vs_SE} (see also Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexErrConv_bias_vs_SE} in Table \ref{tbl:tests}).  We find however that in case of $\delta(m-M) \lesssim 0.2 \text{ mag}$ (if also $\delta \mu \lesssim 2 ~\text{mas yr}^{-1}$ and a maximum distance of $r_\text{max} = 3~\text{kpc}$, see Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexErrConv_bias_vs_SE} in Table \ref{tbl:tests}) the potential parameters can still be recovered within 2 sigma \Wilma{[TO DO: Make sure this is what I claim in abstract and discussion.]}. This corresponds to a relative distance uncertainty of $\sim10\%$. The overall precision of the potential recovery is also not degraded much by introducing distance uncertainties of less than $10\%$.

We therefore found that in case we perfectly knew the measurement uncertainties (and the distance uncertainty is negligible), the convolution of the model probability with the measurement uncertainties gives precise and accurate constraints on the model parameters - even if the measurement uncertainty itself is quite large.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figs/isoSphFlexMixCont_violins_2.eps}
\caption{The dependence of the parameter recovery on degree of pollution and temperature of the stellar population. We mix (i.e., pollute) varying amounts of stars from a \texttt{hot} stellar population with stars from a very different \texttt{cooler} population (see Table \ref{tbl:referenceMAPs}), as indicated on the $x$-axis. (All model parameters used to create the mock data are given as Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexMix}, \emph{Example 1}, in Table \ref{tbl:tests}.) The composite polluted mock data set follows a true DF that has a slightly different shape than the qDF. We then analyse it using \RM{} and fit a \emph{single} qDF only. The violins represent the marginalized \pdf{}s for the best fit model parameters.  Some mock data sets are shown in Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMix_mockdata_residuals}, first row, in the same colors as the violins here.  We find that a hot population is much less affected by pollution with stars from a cooler population than vice versa. \Wilma{[TO DO: remove $\sigma_z$ and $h_{\sigma,z}$ panels]} \Wilma{[TO DO: $\text{km s}^{-1}$ and $\text{mas yr}^{-1}$]}}

%FIGURE: isoSphFlexMixDiff

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{figs/isoSphFlexMixDiff_violins_2.eps}
\caption{The dependence of the parameter recovery on the difference in qDF parameters of a 50\%/50\% mixture of two stellar populations and their temperature. The two qDFs from which the stars in each mock data set were drawn are indicated in the legend, with the qDF parameters $\sigma_{R,0}, \sigma_{z,0}$ and $h_R$ differing by $X\%$ (see also Table \ref{tbl:referenceMAPs}), as indicated on the $x$-axis. (The model parameters used for the mock data creation are given as Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexMix}, \emph{Example 2a \& b}, in Table \ref{tbl:tests}.) Each composite mock data set is fitted with a single qDF and the marginalized \pdf{}s are shown as violins. Some mock data sets are shown in figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexMix_mockdata_residuals}, last two rows (color-coded analogous to the violins here). By mixing populations with varying difference in their qDF parameters, we model the effect of finite bin size or abundance errors when sorting stars into different \MAPs{} in the $[\alpha/\mathrm{Fe}]$-vs.-$[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]$ plane and assuming they follow single qDFs (cf. BR13). We find that the bin sizes should be chosen such that the difference in qDF parameters between neighbouring \MAPs{} is less than 20\%. \Wilma{[TO DO: Replace Example 2b analyses.] [TO DO: remove $\sigma_z$ and $h_{\sigma,z}$ panels]} \Wilma{[TO DO: $\text{km s}^{-1}$ and $\text{mas yr}^{-1}$]}}

Lastly, Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexErrSyst} now investigates the effect of a systematic \emph{underestimation} of the true proper motion uncertainties $\delta \mu$ by 10\% and 50\% (see also Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexErrSyst} in Table \ref{tbl:tests}). We find that this causes a bias in the parameter recovery that grows seemingly linear with $\delta \mu$. For an underestimation of only $10\%$ however, the bias is still $\lesssim 2$ sigma for 10,000 stars \Wilma{[TO DO: Check]} - even for $\delta \mu \sim 3~\text{mas yr}^{-1}$.

The size of the bias also depends on the kinematic temperature of the stellar population and the model parameter considered (see Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexErrSyst}). The qDF parameters are for example better recovered by hotter populations. This is, because the \emph{relative} difference between the true $\sigma_i(R)$ (with $i \in \{R,z\}$) and measured $\sigma_i(R)$ (which comes from the deconvolution with an underestimated velocity uncertainty) is smaller for hotter populations.
