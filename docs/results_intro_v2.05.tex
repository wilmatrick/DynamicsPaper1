\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

We are now in a position to explore the limitations of action based modelling posed in the introduction: (i) unbiased estimates; (ii) survey volume; (iii) imperfect selection function; (iv) measurement errors; (v) actual DF or (vi) Potential not spanned by the space of models. We do not explore the breakdown of the assumption that the system is axisymmetric and
in steady state. With the exception of the test suite on measurement errors in \S\ref{sec:results_errors}, we assume that the phase-space errors are negligible. All tests are also summarized in Table \ref{tbl:tests}. 

\HW{[TO DO: Hans-Walter said that there are diagnostic plots in this papers that can be eliminated and their essence summarized in 1-2 sentences in the text. Fine. But which plots does he think can be eliminated? My plots contain either results or are only there to make the paper more readable for others.]}
