\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

We are now in a position to examine the limitations of action-based modelling posed in the introduction (see Section \ref{sec:intro}) using our \RM{} machinery. We explore: (i) unbiased estimates, (ii) the role of the survey volume, (iii) imperfect selection functions, (iv) measurement errors and what happens if the actual (v) DF or (vi) Potential are not spanned by the space of models. We do not explore the breakdown of the assumption that the system is axisymmetric and
in steady state. With the exception of the test suite on measurement errors in \S\ref{sec:results_errors}, we assume that phase-space errors are negligible. All tests are also summarized in Table \ref{tbl:tests}. 

\HW{[TO DO: Hans-Walter said that there are diagnostic plots in this papers that can be eliminated and their essence summarized in 1-2 sentences in the text. Fine. But which plots does he think can be eliminated? My plots contain either results or are only there to make the paper more readable for others.]}
