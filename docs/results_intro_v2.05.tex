\caption{Bias vs. standard error in recovering the potential parameters for mock data stars drawn from four different wedge-shaped test observation volumes within the Galaxy (illustrated in the right panel; the corresponding analyses are colour-coded) and two different potentials (\texttt{Iso-Pot} and \texttt{MW13-Pot} from Table \ref{tbl:referencepotentials}; see also Test \ref{test:wedFlexVol} in Table \ref{tbl:tests} for all model parameters used). Standard error and offset were determined from a Gaussian fit to the marginalized \pdf{}. The angular extent of each wedge-shaped observation volume was adapted such that all have the volume of $4.5 \text{ kpc}^3$, even though their extent in $(R,z)$ is different. Overall there is no clear trend, that an observation volume around the Sun, above the disk or at smaller Galactocentric radii should give remarkably better constraints on the potential than the other volumes.}

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

We are now in a position to examine the limitations of action-based modelling posed in the introduction (see Section \ref{sec:intro}) using our \RM{} machinery. We explore: (i) unbiased estimates, (ii) the role of the survey volume, (iii) imperfect selection functions, (iv) measurement errors and what happens if the actual (v) DF or (vi) Potential are not spanned by the space of models. We do not explore the breakdown of the assumption that the system is axisymmetric and
in steady state. With the exception of the test suite on measurement errors in \S\ref{sec:results_errors}, we assume that phase-space errors are negligible. All tests are also summarized in Table \ref{tbl:tests}. 

\HW{[TO DO: Hans-Walter said that there are diagnostic plots in this papers that can be eliminated and their essence summarized in 1-2 sentences in the text. Fine. But which plots does he think can be eliminated? My plots contain either results or are only there to make the paper more readable for others.]}
