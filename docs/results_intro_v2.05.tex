\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

We are now in a position to examine the limitations of action-based modelling posed in the introduction (see Section \ref{sec:intro}) using our \RM{} machinery. We explore: (i) unbiased estimates, (ii) the role of the survey volume, (iii) imperfect selection functions, (iv) measurement uncertainties and what happens if the actual (v) DF or (vi) Potential are not spanned by the space of models. We do not explore the breakdown of the assumption that the system is axisymmetric and
in steady state. With the exception of the test suite on measurement uncertainties in Section \ref{sec:results_errors}, we assume that phase-space uncertainties are negligible. All tests are also summarized in Table \ref{tbl:tests}.
