\section{Style guide}

\paragraph{On wording}
\begin{itemize}
\item Only mention \MAP{}, where we actually want to mention \MAPs{}. For general points, use "stellar sub-population" of "stellar sub-sample".
\item Only mention qDF, where applicable. Use DF otherwise.
\item Stress, that this is a general approach, that uses action-based disk DFs for getting the potential. (Less focus on qDF.) qDF is only a specific example.
\item Use measurement uncertainties instead of measurement errors
\item Make consistent use of \pdf{} and likelihood.
\item "sigma" for confidence
\item units never with $km/s$, always with $km s^{-1}$
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Format}
\begin{itemize}
\item No paragraph titles.
\item Comma after e.g. and i.e.
\item Fe, H no italics, but  mathrm
\item \S only for sections in Binney and Tremaine
\item Abs√§tze mit Indent. Keine Leerzeilen.
\end{itemize}
