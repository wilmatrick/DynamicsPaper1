\subsection{Influence of wrong assumptions about incompleteness of the data parallel to the Galactic plane} \label{sec:incompZ}

In \S\ref{sec:results_incompR} we found a striking robustness of the \RM modelling approach against wrong assumptions about the radial incompleteness of the data set. To further test this result, we investigate a different completeness function that drops with distance from the Galactic plane (see Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexIncomp}, Example 2, in Table \ref{tbl:tests} and Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexIncompZ_mockdata}). We get a similar robust behaviour for small deviations, and only slightly less robustness for larger deviations. That an explanation for this robustness could be, that a lot of information about the potential comes from the rotation curve, which is not affected by incompleteness, is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexIncomp_marginal_violins}.

\paragraph{Marginalization over $v_T$.} The likelihood in Equation (\ref{eq:prob}) is marginalized over the coordinate $v_T$ as follows
\begin{eqnarray*}
&&\left. \mathscr{L}(\pmodel \mid D)\right|_\text{($v_T$ marg.)}\\
&=& \prod_i^N P_\text{($v_T$ marg.)} (\vect{x}_i,v_{R,i},v_{z,i} \mid \pmodel)\\
&\equiv& \prod_i^N v_0 \cdot \int_0^{1.5v_\text{circ}(R_\odot)} \diff v_T \ P(\vect{x}_i,v_{R,i},v_{T},v_{z,i} \mid \pmodel )
\end{eqnarray*}
where $P(\vect{x},\vect{v} \mid \pmodel)$ is the same as in Equation (\ref{eq:prob}) and the numerical integral over $v_T$ is performed as a 24th order Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The additional factor of $v_0$ is needed to get the units of $P_\text{($v_T$ marg.)} (\vect{x}_i,v_{R,i},v_{z,i} \mid \pmodel)$ right.

\caption{Selection function and mock data distribution for investigating vertical incompleteness of the data. All model parameters are summarized as Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexIncomp}, Example 2, in Table \ref{tbl:tests}. The survey volume is a sphere around the sun and the percentage of observed stars is decreasing linearly with distance from the Galactic plane, as demonstrated in the left panel. How fast this detection/incompleteness rate drops is quantized by the factor $\epsilon_z$. Histograms for four data sets, drawn from two \MAPs{} (\texttt{hot} in red and \texttt{cool} in blue, see Table \ref{tbl:referenceMAPs}) and with two different $\epsilon_z$, 0 and 0.7, are shown in the right panel for illustration purposes.

\caption{Influence of wrong assumptions about the incompleteness parallel to the Galactic plane of the data on the parameter reocovery with \RM{}. Each mock data set was created having different incompleteness parameters $\epsilon_z$ (shown on the $x$-axis and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexIncompZ_mockdata}) and the model parameters are given as Test \ref{test:isoSphFlexIncomp}, Example 2, in Table \ref{tbl:tests}. The analysis however didn't know about the incompleteness and assumed that all data sets had constant completeness within the survey volume ($\epsilon_z = 0$). The marginalized likelihoods from the fits are shown as violins. The green lines mark the true potential parameters (\texttt{Iso-Pot}) and the red and blue lines the true qDF parameters (\texttt{hot} \MAP{} in red and \texttt{cool} \MAP{} in blue), which we tried to recover. The \RM{} method seems to be robust against small to intermediate deviations between the true and the assumed vertical data incompleteness, as well as the radial incompleteness in Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexIncompZ_violins}.

\caption{Influence of wrong assumptions about radial and vertical incompleteness on the parameter recovery, when \emph{not} including information about the tangential velocities in the analysis. The mock data sets are the same as in Figure \ref{fig:isoSphFlexIncompR_violins} and \ref{fig:isoSphFlexIncompZ_violins}, but this time we did not include the data coordinates $v_T$ in the analysis and therefore marginalized the likelihood over $v_T$ instead (see \S\ref{sec:incompZ}). This demonstrates that a lot of information about the potential is actually stored in the rotation curve, i.e. $v_T(R)$, which is not affected by removing stars from the data set. But even if we do not include $v_T$ we can still recover the potential within the errors, at least for small ($\epsilon_z \lesssim 10\%$).
