Dear Ms. Trick,\\

I have received the referee's report on your submission to The Astrophysical
Journal, and append it below.

I hope that you will agree with my assessment that the report is constructive in
tone, but you will note that the referee asks that a number of issues be addressed
before publication in the ApJ.
  
Following the referee's report, I have also appended some comments regarding the
statistical aspects of your manuscript. ApJ submissions with a statistical component
are routinely previewed by Dr. Eric Feigelson, the member of the ApJ editorial board
with a broad expertise in statistical matters in an astrophysical context. Perhaps
these comments will be of use to you as you prepare your revision. If you have any
questions about the comments, however, please direct them to me, not to Dr.
Feigelson.
Please consider the report carefully. When you resubmit, please include a \Wilma{detailed cover letter indicating point-by-point your responses to the referee's report}, and also indicating any \Wilma{other changes you have made} to the text.

\section{Reviewer's Comments:}

This paper details and tests a framework for constraining the Milky Way potential
using action-based dynamical distribution functions. The work very much builds on
previous work from two of the authors as well as the dynamics group in Oxford.
However, for the first time the machinery and its assumptions are quite rigorously
tested and the paper thoroughly discusses the limitations and downfalls of the
methods.\\

I believe that this work should be published but that there are parts of the paper
where the presentation could be clearer and where the discussion could be expanded
or reduced. Additionally, I think that this paper will be a good reference paper for
those who will fit dynamical models to the Gaia data, but there are a number of
places where the paper could be made more `usable' without much effort.\\

My main complaint with the paper, however, is that it doesn't tackle the `real'
problem for three reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. The selection volumes considered seem unrealistic. It is unclear how they relate to what one might use with the Gaia data.\\
\Wilma{[Comment from HW: E.g. how to deal with complex sampling volumes has been demonstrated in Bovy et al 2013 and 2015; the point here is to make a generic exploration of search volume shapes.]}
\item 2. It is unclear how the error distributions relate to the anticipated errors from the Gaia data.
\item 3. The majority of the tests seem to be done with the isochrone potential. This is obviously done for speed reasons. A few cases are tackled with the KKS-Pot and one
case with the MW13-Pot. \HW{It is then not clear how the precision of the potential
parameter recovery for the isochrone relates to more realistic potentials (e.g.
will the circular velocity always be so well constrained irrespective of the
potential form?).} \HW{The issue of computational speed is mentioned in the discussion
but I think this issue is slightly glossed over.} \HW{Using more realistic potentials in all cases would obviously be much better and would also test the `Staeckel fudge'
apparatus more fully.} \HW{The improvements to this apparatus are highlighted in the
paper but I don't think that it is shown that it has been fully tested.} I think
that the heavy use of the isochrone potential should be flagged in the abstract.
\end{itemize}

It would be good if some of these concerns were brought to the fore and highlighted
in the paper. I have detailed places in the paper where things could be changed.
There is also a short list of typos at the end.\\\\


\section{Abstract}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. 4th sentence -- explain what 'slightly wrong' means more quantitatively.
\item 2. 5th sentence -- Are the constraints of high precision on the potential or DF? -- clarify
\item 3. The tests referred to in the abstract have been performed independently but the lists suggest that you have shown that when all the listed conditions are satisfied the constraints are of high precision. This should be clarified.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. Magorrian (2014) has provided a framework for constraining the potential without assuming a particular parametrized form for the DF. Whilst Magorrian's method is computationally intensive, it should be referenced in the introduction as it relates to the later discussion of choosing a particular DF parametrization.
\item 2. At the end of the introduction I think that you should refer people more strongly to the results section as much of section 2 is presenting a framework that appears elsewhere.
\end{itemize}

\section{Dynamical Modelling}

\subsection{Section 2.2}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. A slightly fuller introduction of the actions is merited. Mention why the actions are introduced. What advantages do they present? Also state that the action-angles are canonical -- this is important later for transformation of the pdf.
\item 2. The third sentence isn't quite right -- the most general are the triaxial
Staeckel potentials of which the axisymmetric Staeckel potentials are special cases
and all spherical potentials are special cases of these. THe isochrone potential is
the most general potential in which the actions are not computed as a quadrature.
\item 3. The potential discussion could be put into a separate section. Also mention that the circular speed at the Sun is the same for all three potentials. Re-iterate that the reason for using the isochrone and Staeckel potential is the ease with which the actions can be computed.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Section 2.3}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1. Guiding-center should not be in brackets as this is important. \Comment{Done.}
\item 2. The final sentence of the left-hand column of Fig 3 should read $L<<L_0$. \Jo{[TO DO: Ask Jo, if this is correct.]} \Wilma{[TO DO: First look it up in BR13.]}
\item 3. Top of page 4 -- explain what X is in the text.
\item 4. Do you interpolate in log density?
\item 5. The footnote says 'should be chosen as' -- add a forward reference to Fig. 4
\end{itemize}

\Wilma{[TO DO: Continue here]}

Section 2.4
-----------
1. An entire section dedicated to this topic seems unnecessary. See below.

Section 2.5
-----------
1. As this section only explains technical details rather than testing the apparatus
I think that this section can be put in an appendix along with Fig. 2 and 3. Fig 2
and 3 are illustrative but I think that they are similar to BR13 Fig2 and 3 so do
not need to appear in the main body. I don't think it is a 'test' so should be
removed from Table 3.
2. The discussion of selection on very errorneous x coordinates is interesting but
surely this isn't the way the data will actually be handled?

Section 2.6
-----------
1. The selection function can be briefly mentioned at the beginning of this section
and stated that you assume here for simplicity it is a function of $\vec{x}$.
2. The Jacobian from J,theta to x,v should be mentioned here.
3. pdf should be defined in a separate equation.
4. Figure 4. -- it wasn't clear to me that the 'truth' normalization used a high
enough set of parameters. $N_x=20$, $N_v=56$ and $n_\sigma=7$ only seem slightly larger than
the values actually compared to.
5. Make the normalization discussion a separate section.
6. The discussion of the likelihood normalization should reference and compare with
McMillan and Binney (2013) as the discussion is very similar.
7. Is there any general advice on how to choose $N_x$, $N_v$ and $N_sigma$? The authors
have shown it is OK for the mock datasets but do I have to redo the authors'
exercise when I have a real dataset?
8. Put error discussion in separate section.
9. Reduce size of caption for Fig 5. More of the details could go in the text.
10. Equation (15) is a novelty. It is troubling that the tests that use this
approximation all seem to use the isochrone but the approximation is still
necessary. Is that because it is computationally awkward to calculate this integral
or just very slow?
11. The penultimate sentence of this section contradicts the previous sentence
without validation. Why is this?


Section 2.7
-----------
1. I liked this section -- it was well thought out and informative.
2. Here a fixed sampling is used for the error samples. I think again you should
reference McMillan \& Binney (2013) as they discussed the numerical stability of this
method.

Section 3
---------
1. It is stated that the breakdown of axisymmetry and steady state assumptions is
not explored. I wonder as well about the impact of resonances, particularly when the
data are very high quality. This cannot be explored in the current setup as the data
are generated from an action-based DF but perhaps should be mentioned as a potential
limitation of the approach.

Section 3.1
-----------
1. This seems a good sanity check but should it be published? Fig 6. seems
sufficient to me to demonstrate that your code works. I don't think the paper would
miss this section.


Section 3.2
-----------
1. I understand that the selections used in Fig 9 are illustrative but the pink
selection just doesn't seem realistic. I think Fig 8. is a sufficient demonstration
of the difference between different selections. Fig. 9 doesn't add anything and is
barely discussed in the text. Also, without observational uncertainties (which will
be greater for the more distant boxes) the discussion seems superficial. I would
consider removing this.

Section 3.3
------------
1. Isn't the reason for the cold population being more robust that it doesn't have
as many stars at large distance as the hot population so it is less affected by the
cuts? I suppose this not necessarily true for lines-of-sight in the plane.

Section 3.4
------------
1. It would be nice to state how the considered errors are related to the
anticipated Gaia errors or other surveys. What is the motivation for considering
these errors?

Section 3.5
-----------
1. I think this and section 3.6 are the most valuable in the paper as they really
explore potential systematics. In my opinion, these are the key results.
2. Fig 15. -- it would be interesting to see the difference between the fits and the
truth. Do the fits break down in particular places?

Section 3.6
-----------
1. Fig 19 is difficult to interpret. Is it possible to display the difference?
2. The fact the density is not well recovered seems interesting as it points to
possible biases in the surface density of the disc/dark matter measurements if one
uses the wrong potential. It would be good to have the discreapncy quantized in the
text.
3. I think Fig. 20 could be removed. As mentioned it doesn't make sense to compare
the DF parameters between different potentials so I am not sure what Fig 20 is
telling us.

Section 3.7
-----------
1. Should this section be moved to the discussion section?

Summary \& Discussion
--------------------
1. Perhaps add statements comparing the errors explored to those anticipated from Gaia.
2. The two approaches mentioned at the end of 'Gravitational potential beyond
the...' are stated as formally similar but I think it is clear that one is better
than the other. The true Staeckel approach limits you to potentials with the same
foci. This is an obvious limitation and has been discussed before.
3. The definition of X in f(J,[X/H]) doesn't seem to make sense.
4. The first section in future work is very interesting. Use of different DFs and
potentials as explored in this paper is interesting but a true test of the apparatus
on a more realistic galaxy would make the 'RoadMapping' tool much more attractive.
5. I think that the final two questions of the future work section are weak. Clearly
the rotation curve is only describing the in-plane force not the force everywhere.
Parametrizations will naturally convince you that the rotation curve is well
measured but I think there is a lot more flexibility. Also, the advantage of using
the approximate actions is that more realistic potentials can be considered.

Table 3
-------
1. Can you add a summary column that summarizes the result? This would make the
paper much more 'usable'.

An elaborate Bayesian inferential procedure is described in sec 2.6-2.7 for
parameter estimation with results shown in Fig 6. But with uninformative uniform
priors and a simply unimodal likelihood with a nearly multivariate normal
distribution, this effort is unnecessary. The same result would be obtained with
maximum likelihood estimation via the EM Algorithm (probably >>100 iterations with
convergence guaranteed by theorem) and parameter uncertainties estimated from the
Fisher Information Matrix. The confluence of Bayesian and MLE procedures in this
case should be presented.
